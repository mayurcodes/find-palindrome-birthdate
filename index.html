    <h1>Hey There!!! Let's check out if your birthdate is palindrome. </h1>
    <h2>A <i> palindrome </i> is a word, sentence, verse, or even number that reads 
        the same backward or forward. It derives from Greek roots that 
        literally mean “running back” (palin is “again, back,” and 
        dromos, “running.”) The word appears to have been created in English 
        based on these roots in the early 1600s.
